### IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

The Iris Flower Classification project is a machine learning application designed to classify iris flowers into one of three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on the size of their sepals and petals. This project is part of an internship program and showcases the use of various machine learning algorithms to solve a classification problem.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris Flower Dataset, which includes 150 samples with four features each: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters, for each flower. The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set to evaluate the performance of the model.

### Features


- Four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

- Target classes: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica.

### Machine Learning Model

This project uses the  Logistic Regression to train the model. The choice of algorithm(s) is based on their suitability for handling small datasets with high accuracy.
